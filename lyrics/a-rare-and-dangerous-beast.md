Oh, you may have caught a flashing glimpse of it before,  
but it's a rare and dangerous beast - and if it bites you,  
you'll recognise its teethmarks on your skin, for sure.  
Even if it's just a graze, it will excite you.

Your blood will pump;  
your ears will pound;  
your mouth will go bone dry  
and then on fire, on fire.

Your blood will pump;  
your ears will pound;  
your mouth will go bone dry  
and then on fire.

Your blood will pump;  
your ears will pound;  
your mouth will go bone dry  
and then on fire.

Can any antidote  
ever be found  
for the venom in a kiss  
that's full of love and of desire ?
