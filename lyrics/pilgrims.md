  Rain against the window.\
  Umbrellas against the wind.\
  The silhouette of buildings\
  against the granite sky.

  Rain against the window.\
  Umbrellas against the wind.\
  The silhouette of buildings\
  against the granite sky.

  In the station, you were reading\
  your second book in Spanish.\
  You're always reading,\
  always reading, always reading.\
  And now you're smiling,\
  smiling, smiling;\
  and I am smiling too, watching you.

  You're always reading, always reading.\
  You're always reading, always reading.\
  You're always reading, always reading.\
  You're always reading, always reading,\
  and I am smiling too, watching you.

  Let the rain fall on us.\
  Let it happen; it doesn't matter.\
  Let the rain fall on us.\
  Let it rain.\
  In Santiago, we are pilgrims.\
  Come on, let's walk together.\
  Let the rain fall on us.\
  It can't be far.
