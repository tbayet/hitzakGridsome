A book can hide many things between its covers  
-and I'm not just talking metaphorically.  
Take this one, this little black book of mine:  
neat little letters and bright blue ink,  
page after page of thoughts, memories,  
people, places,  
secrets, dreams.

And all of that turned into songs.  
Page after page of thoughts, memories,  
people, places,  
secrets, dreams.  
And all of that,  
all of that,  
all of that turned into songs.
